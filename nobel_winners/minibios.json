The two students succeeded and also developed a method to measure small levels of muscle creatinine. Ochoa spent the summer of 1927 in Glasgow working with D. Noel Paton on <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine\" title=\"Creatine\">creatine</a> metabolism improving his English skills. During the summer he refined the assay procedure further and upon returning to Spain he and Valdecasas submitted a paper describing the work to the <i><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Biological_Chemistry\" title=\"Journal of Biological Chemistry\">Journal of Biological Chemistry</a></i>, where it was rapidly accepted,<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severo_Ochoa#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup> marking the beginning of Ochoa's biochemistry career.<sup id=\"cite_ref-frs_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severo_Ochoa#cite_note-frs-7\">[7]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Ochoa completed his undergraduate medical degree in the summer of 1929 and developed an interest in going abroad to gain further research experience. His previous creatine and creatinine work led to an invitation to join <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Meyerhof\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Otto Meyerhof\">Otto Meyerhof</a>'s laboratory at the Kaiser Wilhelm\nInstitute for Biology in Berlin-Dahlem in 1929. At that time the Institute was a \"hot bed\" of the rapidly evolving discipline of biochemistry, and thus Ochoa had the experience of meeting and interacting with scientists such as Otto Warburg, Carl Neuberg, Einar\nLundsgaard, and Fritz Lipmann in addition to Meyerhof who had received the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine less than a decade earlier.\n</p><p>In 1930 Ochoa returned to Madrid to complete research for his MD thesis, which he defended that year. In 1931, a newly minted MD, he married Carmen Garc\u00eda Cobi\u00e1n, he did not have any children. He then began postdoctoral study at the London National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR), where he worked with <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Hallett_Dale\" title=\"Henry Hallett Dale\">Henry Hallett Dale</a>. His London research involved the enzyme glyoxalase and was an important departure in Ochoa's career in two respects. First, the work marked the beginning of Ochoa's lifelong interest in enzymes. Second, the project was at the cutting edge of the rapidly evolving study of intermediary metabolism.<sup id=\"cite_ref-hobby_3-2\" class=\"reference\"><a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severo_Ochoa#cite_note-hobby-3\">[3]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1933 the Ochoas returned to Madrid where he began to study glycolysis in heart muscle. Within two years, he was offered the directorship of the Physiology Section in a newly created Institute for Medical Research at the University of Madrid Medical School. Unfortunately the appointment was made just as the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War\" title=\"Spanish Civil War\">Spanish Civil War</a> erupted. Ochoa decided that trying to perform research in such an environment would destroy forever his \"chances of becoming a scientist.\" Thus, \"after much thought, my wife and I decided to leave Spain.\" In September 1936 Severo and Carmen began what he later called the \"wander years\" as they traveled from Spain to Germany, to England, and ultimately to the United States within a span of four years.<sup id=\"cite_ref-hobby_3-3\" class=\"reference\"><a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severo_Ochoa#cite_note-hobby-3\">[3]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severo_Ochoa#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Ochoa left Spain and returned to Meyerhof's  Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology now relocated in Heidelberg, where Ochoa found a profoundly changed research focus. During his 1930 visit the laboratory work was \"classical physiology,\" which Ochoa described as \"one could see muscles twitching everywhere\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-hobby_3-4\" class=\"reference\"><a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severo_Ochoa#cite_note-hobby-3\">[3]</a></sup> By 1936 Meyerhof's laboratory had become one of the world's foremost biochemical facilities focused on processes such as glycolysis and fermentation. Rather than studying muscles \"twitch,\" the lab was now purifying and characterizing the enzymes involved in muscle action but were involved in yeast fermentation.\n</p><p>From then until 1938, he held many positions and worked with many people at many places. For example, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Meyerhof\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Otto Meyerhof\">Otto Meyerhof</a> appointed him Guest Research Assistant at the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck_Institute_for_Medical_Research\" title=\"Max Planck Institute for Medical Research\">Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research</a> in <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidelberg\" title=\"Heidelberg\">Heidelberg</a> for one year.

At that time the Institute was a \"hot bed\" of the rapidly evolving discipline of biochemistry, and thus Ochoa had the experience of meeting and interacting with scientists such as Otto Warburg, Carl Neuberg, Einar\nLundsgaard, and Fritz Lipmann in addition to Meyerhof who had received the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine less than a decade earlier.\n</p><p>In 1930 Ochoa returned to Madrid to complete research for his MD thesis, which he defended that year.

Ochoa decided that trying to perform research in such an environment would destroy forever his \"chances of becoming a scientist.\" Thus, \"after much thought, my wife and I decided to leave Spain.\" In September 1936 Severo and Carmen began what he later called the \"wander years\" as they traveled from Spain to Germany, to England, and ultimately to the United States within a span of four years.<sup id=\"cite_ref-hobby_3-3\" class=\"reference\"><a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severo_Ochoa#cite_note-hobby-3\">[3]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severo_Ochoa#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Ochoa left Spain and returned to Meyerhof's  Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology now relocated in Heidelberg, where Ochoa found a profoundly changed research focus.

Her works \"Save the Reaper\" and \"Passion\" came out in two different versions in the same year, in 1998 and 2004 respectively. At the other end of the scale, two stories were republished in a variant version about 30 years later, \"Home\" (1974/2006/2014) and \"Wood\" (1980/2009).<sup id=\"cite_ref-33\" class=\"reference\"><a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Munro#cite_note-33\">[33]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Ann Close and Lisa Dickler Awano reported in 2006 that Munro had not wanted to reread the galleys of <i>Runaway</i> (2004): \"No, because I'll rewrite the stories.\" In their symposium contribution <i>An Appreciation of Alice Munro</i> they say that of her story \"Powers\", for example, Munro did eight versions in all.<sup id=\"cite_ref-34\" class=\"reference\"><a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Munro#cite_note-34\">[34]</a></sup> \n</p><p>Awano writes that \"Wood\" is a good example of how Munro, being \"a tireless self-editor\",<sup id=\"cite_ref-Awano_2012_35-0\" class=\"reference\"><a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Munro#cite_note-Awano_2012-35\">[35]</a></sup> rewrites and revises a story, in this case returning to it for a second publication nearly thirty years later. In this case, Awano says, Munro revised characterizations, themes and perspectives, as well as rhythmic syllables, a conjunction or a punctuation mark. The characters change, too. Inferring from the perspective they take on things, they are middle-age in 1980, and in 2009 they are older. Awano perceives a heightened lyricism brought about not least by the poetic precision of the revision undertaken by the author.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Awano_2012_35-1\" class=\"reference\"><a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Munro#cite_note-Awano_2012-35\">[35]</a></sup> The 2009 version is made up of eight sections instead of three in 1980, and it has a new ending. Awano writes that Munro literally \"refinishes\" the first take on the story, with an ambiguity that is characteristic of Munro's endings, and that the author re-imagines her stories throughout her work a variety of ways.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Awano_2012_35-2\" class=\"reference\"><a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Munro#cite_note-Awano_2012-35\">[35]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Several stories were re-published with considerable variation as to which content goes into which section. This can be seen, for example, in \"Home\", \"The Progress of Love\", \"What Do You Want to Know For?\", \"The Children Stay\", \"Save the Reaper\", \"The Bear Came Over the Mountain\", \"Passion\", \"The View From Castle Rock\", \"Wenlock Edge\", and \"Deep-Holes\".\n</p><p>Munro married James Munro in 1951. Their daughters Sheila, Catherine, and Jenny were born in 1953, 1955, and 1957 respectively; Catherine died the day of her birth due to the lack of functioning kidneys.<sup id=\"cite_ref-36\" class=\"reference\"><a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Munro#cite_note-36\">[36]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1963, the Munros moved to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia\" title=\"Victoria, British Columbia\">Victoria</a> where they opened <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munro%27s_Books\" title=\"Munro's Books\">Munro's Books</a>, a popular bookstore still in business.
